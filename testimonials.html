  <p class="testimony">
    <em class="content">I wanted to drop you a note of thanks. Our work together has been really helpful and enriching. I was primed for the experience (I just had in an Oxford seminar) in a way that I never would have been before and it is undoubtedly because of the journey you have helped me take for the last several months. This week I palpably felt the progress of my thinking and awareness as well as the extent of my personal growth since last year.</em>
